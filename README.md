# Healthcare Management System


👨‍⚕️ A complete relational database system to manage hospital operations including patient data, admissions, surgeries, room & bed allocations, staff assignments, and billing — all modeled and analyzed using SQL.

## 📌 Project Objective
This project simulates a real-world hospital database using a normalized schema. The goal is to perform structured analysis and generate meaningful insights for hospital administrators and medical staff.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 14 interlinked CSV files, covering:
    ~ Patient records
    ~ Doctors & departments
    ~ Room & bed allocations
    ~ Surgeries, nurses, helpers
    ~ Appointments and billing
    ~ Staff shift management
All tables were connected using primary and foreign keys, and imported into MySQL for querying.

## ✨ Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of real-world database design, SQL data analysis, and helped me practice translating raw data into operational insights.

### Questions 
Let’s solve SQL questions using our hospital database and test how well we can analyze real-world healthcare data!
